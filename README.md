# Business Analytics – Competitor Research (Internship Task)

This repository contains the dataset and Python code I used for Task 1 of my Business Analytics internship assignment at Meru Technosoft Pvt. Ltd. (Hellobooks.ai).

## Contents

bookkeeping_companies.csv ->Dataset I prepared with competitor details (founded year, funding, users, features, etc.).

analysis.py → Python script using Pandas and Matplotlib to generate graphs.

## Analysis Performed

- Funding Comparison (USD Millions)
- User Base Comparison (in millions/downloads)
- Feature Count Comparison

The analysis helped me visualize how HelloBooks compares with competitors like Zoho Books, QuickBooks, HostBooks, and Vyapar in terms of scale, adoption, and product features.
